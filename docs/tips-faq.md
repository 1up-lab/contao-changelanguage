## Tips & Tricks

<dl>

<dt>Do not use flags for the language selection</dt>
<dd>Using flag icons for languages is a very bad idea. Flags represent
    <u>countries</u> and not <u>languages</u>. Not every language belongs to
    only one country! Would you take the American flag, the British flag or
    the Australian flag for english? What flags do you use for <i>Chinese
    Simplified</i> and <i>Chinese Traditional</i> (two different forms of writing
    for the same chinese language)? Don't do itâ€¦</dd>

<dt>Use a select menu for language selection</dt>
<dd>Easy: go to your front end module settings and select <i>nav_dropdown</i> in
    the <i>Navigation template</i> option. <b>BAM!</b>, you're done :-)</dd>

<dt>Customizing alternate link tags</dt>
<dd>By default, <i>ChangeLanguage</i> will add <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"&gt;</code>
    markup to your page's head section. This will tell Google and other search
    engines which pages belong together for better search results.<br><br>
    If you want to customize the alternate tags, you can create a copy of the
    <code>block_alternate_links.html5</code> template and customize the output.</dd>
